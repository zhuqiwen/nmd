<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
	<li><h4>Search bar</h4></li>
	<p>Use search bar for all-text search. It will look into any text field of the database.</p>

	<li><h4>Filter</h4></li>
	<p>You can further filter the results returned by Search Bar. The reset buttom will reload the whole page.</p>

	<li><h4>Tab: records</h4></li>
	<p>This is where you investigate data details. Specifically, <b>doulbe click</b> any table row gives you a pop-up modal to view and edit details; you can also update the record from here. <b>Delete button</b> for each row pops up the deletion confirmation modal.</p>

	<li><h4>Tab: import from XML</h4></li>
	<p>Import data or wipe the database from here. The only accepted data file is <a href="http://www.iu.edu/~iubweb/academic/majors/xml/degree-list.xml">this degree records</a> in <b>the format of XML</b>. Before loaded into the database, the data <b>can be previewed</b>.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Development</h3>
<ul>
	<li><h4>Infrastructure</h4></li>
	<p>Having been developing using MVC for years, I'm not very comfortable with a single .php file application. Instead, <b>I brewed a hand-made, micro MVC frame work</b> for this project, to ease the difficulties of development.</p>
